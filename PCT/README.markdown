# PCT

I recently was going through some very old 5 1/4" floppies, and discovered these.  They are the source code to my very first significant C program, Ticketron's PCT (Personal Computer Terminal)

The dates on the file range from 25-Feb-1987 to 11-Jan-1988.

The program is based on (and replaces) on dedicated embedded system written in assembler, to sell tickets on the Ticketron network.

I left Ticketron in 1991, when Ticketron ceased to exist as an undependant company.  What used to be Ticketron continued on for some time (and possibly to the present) as the ticketing division of the Shubert Organization.  They continued to use it until at least 1998, when I was told they planned to replace it with a Windows version.
